BatchGallery
============

Another project of mine that's a few years old and as gone as it's going to get.

BatchGallery is an app I made around 2010~2011 so I could create and manage image galleries via [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/), back when they had the "public" folder.  The Batch part sucks up a directory filled with images and creates smaller and thumbnail versions, all while indexing them in an XML and/or HTML files.  The Gallery part is what generates the HTML, from the XML file, and manage (okay, just add) images in the list.

I use it for a couple of picture collections.  It was coded in Visual Studio Express 2008, upgraded to 2010, BUT since it's built off WinForms it's gone as far as I'm taking it.

The code is free for anyone to use, examine, recycle, etc.
